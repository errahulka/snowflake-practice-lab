## Snowflake Lab Code

Here you will find the sample practice lab that I have had done. 
Few of them are from Snowflake samples and few are from me, or elsewhere. I am just trying to put everything here for easier access and value add.

## Contributing


All new code should be created in a new directory inside `labs` with your complete source code. 
Be sure to include a readme.md file inside your newly created directory so users know how to use your code in their own projects.
